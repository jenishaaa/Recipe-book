            </div>
<ul>
    <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>Pizza sauce or tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice:
        <ul>
            <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>Sliced bell peppers</li>
            <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>Sliced black olives</li>
            <li>Sliced onions</li>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>

    <li>Dried oregano</li>
    <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional for heat)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</li>
    <p>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting (usually around 475°F or 245°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.</p>

    <li>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</li>
    <p>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. You can use a rolling pin to achieve an even shape.</p>

    <li>Step 3: Prepare the Pizza Pan</li>
    <p>If you're using a pizza stone, sprinkle it with cornmeal to prevent sticking. If you're using a baking sheet, lightly grease it with olive oil.</p>

    <li>Step 4: Transfer the Dough</li>
    <p>Transfer the rolled-out dough to the pizza stone or baking sheet, ensuring it covers the surface evenly.</p>

    <li>Step 5: Add Sauce and Cheese</li>
    <p>Spread pizza sauce or tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.</p>

    <li>Step 6: Add Toppings</li>
    <p>Layer your choice of toppings, such as pepperoni slices, sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, onions, and more, on the cheese.</p>

    <li>Step 7: Season and Bake</li>
    <p>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza, sprinkle minced garlic, dried oregano, and optionally crushed red pepper flakes for added heat. Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p>

    <li>Step 8: Serve</li>
    <p>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a moment, slice it into pieces, and serve hot.</p>

        <li>Ground cumin</li>
        <li>Ground coriander</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Red chili powder (adjust to your preferred spiciness)</li>
        <li>Amchur (dried mango powder) or lemon juice</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For Frying:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for deep frying)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1: Prepare the Samosa Dough</li>
    <p>Mix all-purpose flour, salt, and a few tablespoons of vegetable oil or ghee in a bowl. Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a smooth, firm dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</p>

    <li>Step 2: Make the Samosa Filling</li>
    <p>Heat some oil in a pan and add finely chopped onions, grated ginger, and minced garlic. Sauté until they turn translucent. Add green chili peppers, boiled and diced potatoes, green peas, and spices (cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt). Cook until the filling is well combined and aromatic. Finish with amchur (dried mango powder) or lemon juice and fresh cilantro leaves.</p>

    <li>Step 3: Prepare Samosa Cones</li>
    <p>Divide the rested dough into small portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it into a small disc. Cut each disc in half to create two semi-circles. Form each semi-circle into a cone shape by sealing the straight edge with a little water.</p>

    <li>Step 4: Fill the Cones</li>
    <p>Fill each cone with a spoonful of the prepared samosa filling. Press the edges together to seal the cone, creating a triangular shape.</p>

    <li>Step 5: Heat Oil for Frying</li>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat.</p>

    <li>Step 6: Fry the Samosas</li>
    <p>Carefully slide the filled samosas into the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.</p>

    <li>Step 7: Serve</li>
    <p>Let the samosas cool for a moment, then serve them with chutney or a dipping sauce of your choice. Enjoy your homemade samosas!</p>
